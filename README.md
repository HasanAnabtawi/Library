# Library System Project

 Library System is a system which helps Libraries to Manage the books in The Libraries. It consists of two parts: Admin part used by 
 Librarian to add and manage the books and categories in the library, and the other part of the systme is to show the books details and availability in the Library for the guests of the Library system.

I built this project using Asp.Net Core MVC Web Framework, and used of Bootstrap Library in the views to edit the style of the HTML Elements with using of free web site template and editing on it to match the functionality and requirements of the project.
